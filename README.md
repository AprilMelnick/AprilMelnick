Making my way through my first two bootcamps: UX & UI with CareerFoundry, I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy? As I considered this, I had a small epiphany: of course! A coffee shop bar is an interface.

UX felt familiar because as a Manager and Start-up Consultant for high end coffee shops, I had spent over a decade building and maintaining structures that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money. 

A melding of business and marketing instinct with a systems thinking approach.
 
But while designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?

And since I find practical information ever so exciting, I started learning Webflow. 

As I got deeper in to Webflow, learning about proper class naming and how not to deep stack, I realized that I really enjoyed structuring information. 

So when my Career Coach mentioned that the way I spoke about projects reminds her of her Growth Hacker friends, we found Marketing Analytics. I signed up for the boot camp and am now on my way.

That's my journey so far: not typical, but practical.
