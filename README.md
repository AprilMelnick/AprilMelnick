Making my way through my first two bootcamps: UX & UI with CareerFoundry, I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy? 

UX felt familiar because as a Start-up Consultant and Manager for high end coffee shops, 
I had spent over a decade ▪️**building and maintaining structures**▪️ that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money. 
 
Considering this, I had a small epiphany: of course! 
A coffee shop bar is an interface.
A melding of ▪️**business and marketing instinct with a systems thinking approach**▪️.
 
But while designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?
And since I find practical information ever so exciting, I started learning Webflow. 

As I got deeper in to Webflow, I realized that not only did I enjoy digging into the structure of web design but I also liked moving in to a less customer facing role. 

When my Career Coach mentioned that the way I spoke about my projects reminds her of her Growth Hacker friends, we did some research and found Marketing Analytics. I signed up for the boot camp and am now on my way.

That's my journey so far: ▪️**not typical, but practical**▪️.
