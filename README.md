After a long career in specialty coffee, it was time for a change. Making my way through my UX course, I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy? As I considered this, I had a small epiphany: of course it's easy. AÂ coffee shop bar is an interface!
  
UX felt familiar because I had spent over a decade building and maintaining structures that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money.  

    ðŸ”™   BUT, I rarely felt the flow state while studying UX.

UI was next. Design felt natural to me, as I've run my own small experimental fashion label: conceptualizing, drafting patterns and producing the clothes. UI seemed a good fit.

    ðŸ”™   With UI, there was flow, but no passion.

While designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?  
  
Since I find practical information ever so exciting, I started learning Webflow. No-code development brought me one step closer to cracking the developer puzzle.

    ðŸ”œ   More understanding, more flow...

Next, a round of sessions with a career coach turned me on to Marketing Analytics. Together we realized that I had:
- Practical, real world marketing experience
- Excellent problem solving skills
- Ability to quickly learn new programs
- Effective communication
- Lots of self-motivation

When I found the WBS Coding School Marketing Analytics course, I signed up!

Diving right in to the course, HTML and CSS were easy to grasp, thanks to my Figma and Webflow skills. 

    ðŸ”›   Flowing...

Querying databases, Google Tag Manager, JavaScript, everything the course threw at me, I rolled right through. Troubleshooting and debugging happily along the way. 

    ðŸ”›   DEFINITELY flowing, the beginnings of passion...

Not only did I learn technical skills, but during this process, I proved to myself that I have the ability to provide meaningful quantitative and qualitative business insight. And that's where the passion comes in. 

At heart, I'm a problem solver. And now that I'm prepared with an analytic tool belt, I'm looking for the next project to sink my teeth into!
