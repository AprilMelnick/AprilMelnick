Making my way through my first two bootcamps: UX & UI with CareerFoundry, I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy? As I considered this, I had a small epiphany: of course! A coffee shop bar is an interface.

UX felt familiar because as a Start-up Consultant and Manager for high end coffee shops, I had spent over a decade 🔹*building and maintaining structures*🔹 that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money. 

A melding of 🔹*business and marketing instinct with a systems thinking approach*🔹.
 
But while designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?

And since I find practical information ever so exciting, I started learning Webflow. 

As I got deeper in to Webflow, learning about proper class naming and how not to deep stack, I realized that I really enjoyed structuring information. 

When my Career Coach mentioned that the way I spoke about projects reminds her of her Growth Hacker friends, we did some research and found Marketing Analytics. I signed up for the boot camp and am now on my way.

That's my journey so far: 🔹*not typical, but practical*🔹.
