At heart, I'm a problem solver and systems thinker. Considering the entire ecosystem of a project and asking the right questions is my strength. 

Delivering information in a people-friendly way is a skill I've honed through years of explaining complicated coffee processes and probably the skill I'm most proud of.

☕️ Wait... coffee? Yes, I'm in a career transition. Let me tell you a bit about my journey.

After a long career in specialty coffee, it was time for a change. UX seemed like a good use of my transferrable skills and I was surprised to find it all kind of conceptually... easy?
  
UX felt familiar because I had spent over a decade building and maintaining structures that keep customers caffeinated, employees happy and bosses making money.  

  🔙   BUT, I rarely felt the flow state while studying UX.

UI was next. Design felt natural to me, as I've run my own small experimental fashion label: conceptualizing, drafting patterns and producing the clothes. UI seemed a good fit.

  🔙   With UI, there was flow, but no passion.

While designing, there was one thing I couldn't keep from creeping in to my mind: what about the developers? How would they feel about my designs?  
  
Since I find practical information ever so exciting, I started learning Webflow. No-code development brought me one step closer to cracking the developer puzzle.

  🔜   More understanding, more flow...

Next, a round of sessions with a career coach turned me on to Marketing Analytics. Together we realized that I had:
- Practical, real world marketing experience
- Excellent problem solving skills
- Ability to quickly learn new programs
- Effective communication
- Lots of self-motivation

When I found the WBS Coding School Marketing Analytics course, I signed up!

Diving right in to the course, HTML and CSS were easy to grasp, thanks to my Figma and Webflow skills. 

  🔛   Flowing...

Querying databases, Google Tag Manager, JavaScript, everything the course threw at me, I rolled right through. Troubleshooting and debugging happily along the way. 

  🔛   DEFINITELY flowing, the beginnings of passion...

Not only did I learn technical skills, but during this process, I proved to myself that I have the ability to provide meaningful quantitative and qualitative business insight.

And now that I'm prepared with an analytic tool belt, I'm ready to find solutions for you.
